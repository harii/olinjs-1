// alright here i'm gonna try and write the code that 
//  figures out wtf to do with different types of requests.

// i guess it'll be useful to import the server module, because technically
//  this router is in the server. not sure how that works.

// um, I think I'll turn THIS into a module, like a helper function, and then
//  import it into server.js, where it'll be used with the rest of the server.
//  I think that makes more sense.
